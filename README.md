# Computer-Organization-and-Assembly-Language-Project
Traffic Light System
Project Documentation
•	The system is based on Arduino uno and atmega328p(8-bit microcontroller) 
•	Assembly code written by “m328pdef” library.
•	Code is written according to 4 light combinations in which two is synchronized and other two is synchronize with each other.
•	Project simulation file is also provided.
•	Project simulation is created in Proteus.
•	In order to burn code on Arduino uno either in simulation or on hardware, a hex will be generated against code by Microchip studio software.
•	Use f7 key or through build option on the taskbar.
•	And when hex will be generated, use AVRDUDE to burn code on physical hardware after connecting Arduino device.
•	 

•	From the tree dots, select hex file and, on the bottom press the Program button.

•	Hex file will be in the Debug folder of that project.
